## Preliminary Comments


### 1. Distribution of the duration in minutes of all trips in the network

As we can see from the distribution graph, the majority of trips take a duration of around 10 minutes; the distribution is
highly skewed to the right with very few trips lasting around one hour.

### 1.2 Not equal start and end stations. It can be argued that the customers that take a bike to end a trip in a different
station may show different behaviour from those that end the trip in the same station as it was started.
